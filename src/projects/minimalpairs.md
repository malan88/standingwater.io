- Generated an [Anki deck][0] for recognizing phonemes difficult to hear for an
  American English speaker using “[minimal pairs][1],” words in French which
  differ by only one phoneme
- Used [Requests][2] for automated downloading of the audio files
- Used [BeautifulSoup4][3], requests for scraping the list of minimal pairs in
  an IPython session
