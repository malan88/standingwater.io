This site was built for my father's commercial painting company. It was my first
project in GatsbyJS and was meant to replace [glendalepainting.com][3].
Unfortunately, my father is rather slow to update things and he's still using
the original Joomla-based site.

The gallery is perhaps the most impressive aspect. A friend of mine helped build
that section.

The main page, using react-spring for the parallax, was quite a nightmare.
Parallax is not the easiest to design, but it's a dumpster fire when you have to
do it for mobile devices using background images instead of sprites.

Never again. Just don't.

- [GatsbyJS][0] static site
- [react-spring][1] for parallax animation
- [react-reveal][2] for transition animations
- Deployed using [Netlify][3]
