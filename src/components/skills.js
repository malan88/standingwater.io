        I consider myself principally a Python developer. I have spent the
        past three years developing a diverse range of software in Python,
        from ETL pipelines to password generators to combinatoric
        optimizers. But by far most of my time has been spent developing a
        single web application in the pursuit of my obsession.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consisting of â‰ˆ14,000 lines of code in Python, Flask, and
        SQLAlchemy, <a href="https://anno.wiki">anno.wiki</a> is my pet
        project to supply the world with definitive, collaborative, and
        exhaustive annotations to all the world's great literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, since my childhood I have developed simple websites and
        portfolio sites. Most recently I have spent a lot of time writing in
        GatsbyJS, in which this site is built.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I have begun to explore ML, and am taking several MOOCs on
        statistics and data science.
      </p>
